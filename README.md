# tic-tac-toe

Name one or two features you’d like to implement
If I had the capability, I'd like to implement:
(1) the appearance of a line/strike-through/color change to denote the winner's row
(2) the inability to click the boxes once a winner has been declared
How would you implement those features? Write 2–3 sentences per feature
(1) IF statement that if const win = any of the listed combinations, the squares change to a unique color when checkForWinner ${status} is true
(2) when checkForWinner ${status} is true, onClick is unmounted
